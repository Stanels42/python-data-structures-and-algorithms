## Challenge
The goal of today's challenge was to create a class called binary tree that has the functions to display the values on a certain order. Also the make a binary search tree class that extened the base binary tree. This class should have the methods of add and contains.

## Approach & Efficiency
#### Binary Tree
Order: Time `O(n)` Space: `O(n)`
#### Binary Search Tree
Add: Time `O(h)` Space: `O(1)`<br>
Contains: Time `O(h)` Space `O(1)`

## APIs
#### Binary Search Tree:
Add: In `Value` -> Out: `None`<br>
Contains: In `Value` -> Out: `True/False`<br>
Display Functions: In `None` -> Out: `List`
