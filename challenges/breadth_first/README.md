# Breadth First Tree
Traverse a tree in a breadth first manner and return a list that contains all the elements in the tree in the order they were encountered.

## Challenge
Create a method called breadth first for the binary tree class that traverses a tree and return a list of the values in order. If there are nodes then the function returns None

## Approach & Efficiency
Add: Time: `O(n)`  Space: `O(1)`<br>
Traverse: Time `O(n)`  Space:  `O(n)`

## API
Add: In: `Value` -> Out: `None`<br>
Traverse: In: `Tree` -> Out: `List`
